# Overview

This project was created with the purpose of learning how to use the programming language Rust. It was decided that a calculator capable of solve mathematical operations a little more complicated than the basic ones would be a good project to learn how to use mutable and unmutable variables, expresions, conditions, loops, and functions.

To create the calculator, a main function was created with seven additional ones that control input, solve math, and provide an output. An incursion was also used to calculate the factorial of a number.

The purpose of the calculator is to help users to solve mathematical operations that most of the time cannot be solved easily.

{Provide a link to your YouTube demonstration. It should be a 4-5 minute demo of the software running and a walkthrough of the code. Focus should be on sharing what you learned about the language syntax.}
The following link is a demonstration of how the software works and an explanation of how to code accomplish what it should do.

# Development Environment

Visual Studio Code was used to install Rust and Cargo. From there I set up the environemnt for Rust.
Two main libraries were used to domplete the software. The first one was std::io, used to store the user's input in a variable. The second one was std::thread, used to pause the program for a few seconds to show some information and then let it continue.

# Future Work

Here is a list of things that need to be fixed, improved, and added in the future

- Handle negative numbers
- Combine all the input functions in a single one
- Create more options in the main menu
